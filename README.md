Dutchycorp PTC Wall Auto Completer

The "Dutchycorp PTC Wall Auto Completer" is a userscript designed to automate the completion of PTC (Paid To Click) wall tasks on the DutchyCorp AutoFaucet website. When executed, the script navigates through the PTC wall tasks, interacting with the required elements, and automatically completes the tasks to save time and effort for the user.

Here's a step-by-step overview of what the script does:

1. It identifies all PTC wall tasks on the DutchyCorp AutoFaucet website that have not been previously watched.

2. For each task, the script simulates a click on the "View Ad" button to initiate the task.

3. After clicking, the script waits for the specific duration specified by the stopwatch associated with the task. This duration represents the required time to view the advertisement before proceeding to the next step.

4. If the task includes a "Wait Focus.." element, the script clicks on it and waits again for the specified duration.

5. In case there is no "Wait Focus.." element, the script clicks on a fallback button to mark the task as completed.

6. After completing a task, the script goes back to the main PTC wall page to proceed with the next task.

7. The script continues this process until all PTC wall tasks have been completed.

8. As an additional enhancement, the script displays a progress bar to indicate the completion status of the tasks visually.

9. When all tasks have been completed, the script shows a floating toast notification indicating the successful completion of all tasks.

The "Dutchycorp PTC Wall Auto Completer" script significantly streamlines the process of completing PTC wall tasks, freeing users from manually performing repetitive actions and providing a more efficient and convenient experience while using the DutchyCorp AutoFaucet website.
