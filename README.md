## Overview

The **Dutchycorp PTC Wall Auto Completer** is a high-efficiency, stealth-focused userscript designed to automate the completion of PTC (Paid-To-Click) wall tasks on the [DutchyCorp AutoFaucet](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/ptc/wall.php) platform.

Version 5.9 introduces full stealth capabilities, anti-bot fingerprint cloaking, adaptive watch time learning, and automated task progression.

## What It Does

Upon loading the PTC wall page, the script:

1. **Identifies Available Tasks**  
   Scans for all clickable PTC wall tasks with active "view ad" buttons (icons containing `fa-eye`), excluding those already watched.

2. **Simulates Human Behavior**  
   Clicks each task button with randomized delays and occasional deliberate misclicks to mimic real user interaction.

3. **Waits for Ad Duration**  
   Extracts the required watch time from the page. If unavailable, uses a learned average. Caps at 45 seconds to avoid broken or honeypot tasks.

4. **Handles "Wait Focus" Triggers**  
   If a "Wait Focus.." element appears, it is clicked and the required duration is waited again.

5. **Submits the Task**  
   If a valid task form is detected (`#userForm`), it is submitted programmatically.

6. **Reloads the Wall Page**  
   After each task is completed or skipped, the script reloads the PTC wall to handle the next task.

7. **Tracks Completion Progress**  
   A visual progress bar is displayed at the top of the screen to show completion status.

8. **Displays Feedback**  
   Minimalist toast notifications report task progress, skips, and final status.

9. **Auto-Starts on Load**  
   No user action required â€” the script begins execution automatically after the page loads.

## Key Features

- **Stealth Execution**  
  Spoofs navigator properties (`webdriver`, `languages`, `platform`, etc.) to avoid basic bot detection.

- **Misclick Simulation**  
  Occasionally clicks unrelated buttons to simulate imperfect human input.

- **Adaptive Watch Timer**  
  Learns ad durations over time and uses that to improve performance.

- **Safe Timeout Handling**  
  Skips any ad task longer than 45 seconds to avoid traps or bugs.

- **Auto-Reloading**  
  Cleanly returns to the task list after each completion without relying on fragile back navigation.
